run the ls in coreitils-with-bug and reproduce the 
bug

emacs ls.c

look up the list of functions at the beginning if ls.c
and then I found that 
static void sort_files(void); looked suspicious since
it directly related to the printing order of 
the files

M-x linum-mode
open up the line number mode so i can setup break point 
at the lines i want

C-x 3
M-x gdb
gdb --anotate3 ./ls
split the screen into 2
open gdb in the other window 

C-x o
M-x imenu
sort_files

I look up the function and find out that the first switch 
statement is to tell what type of thing to sort. Since we have
-t option, I look into the time_type, the second switch satement
contains conditions for ctie,mtime and atime, without looking
the whole function, I set up 3 breakpoints at line 2972
2975 and 2978 by using
break ls.c:2972
break ls.c:2975
break ls.c:2978
break ls.c:3000
break ls.c:1259
break ls.c:2366
break ls.c:2371
break ls.c:1260
break ls.c:1301
break ls.c:2884
and I saw red B's appears on my ls.c screen

info b
list all the breakpoints I set in gdb

run -lt /tmp/tmp.6F7VGV43uN
Breakpoint 2, sort_files () at ls.c:2975
therefore we can conclude that the function is sorting
mtime

print sort_reverse
$1 = false
we can conclude that it is assigning 
compare_mtime to func

at breakpoint line:2371
print fils[0]
$5 = {name = 0x61da00 "wwi-armistice", stat = {st_dev = 2054, st_i\
no = 221, st_nlink = 1, st_mode = 33188, st_uid = 15920, st_gid = \
130, __pad0 = 0, st_rdev = 0, st_size = 0, st_blksize = 4096, st_b\
locks = 0, st_atim = {tv_sec = -1613826000, tv_nsec = 0}, st_mtim \
= {tv_sec = -1613826000, tv_nsec = 0}, st_ctim = {tv_sec = 1477605\
929, tv_nsec = 602250984}, __unused = {0, 0, 0}}, linkname = 0x0, \
linkmode = 0, linkok = false, filetype = normal}

as we can see the time is negative, which means
a digits overflow happens

So we know something may go wrong in the compare_mtime
function
So I go to line 2884 found compare_mtime calls
cmp_mtime

I found timespec_cmp may be a problem
so I tried to look up timespec in the code
but I did not find the function
so I guess it may be in some other files
so I look up in the beginning of the code
to find the relavent header files but fail a gain

I go back to the upper directory
do
grep -r "timespec_cmp" ~/assignment5/coreutils-with-bug

and found the header file called timespec.h
in /lib/

cp timespec.h old_timespec.h

copy the timespec.h to another file so we can create
diff file later on
I go into the file and change the timesepc_cmp function
change int diff to long long int diff
and give a clear comparison for return value
1 for >0, 0 for =0 and -1 for <0

after that I do 
./configure
make

and try
./src/ls -lt /tmp/tmp.6F7VGV43uN

and it works properly 

diff -u old_timespec.h timespec.h > lab5.diff

create the diff file

Try run the program on seasnet linux server
./ls -lt wwi-armistice  now1 now
-rw-r--r-- 1 haoranz csugrad 0 2054-12-17 09:28 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 haoranz csugrad 0 2016-10-23 19:34 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 haoranz csugrad 0 2016-10-23 19:34 now

it shows that the file wwi-armistice is actually
createed at year 2054, which is not possible because
right now is 2016
When we create the file on linux machine, it is 
using the Unix time which mean the time the file
created cannot be older than 1970 Jan 1st
But on MSDN, the time is just simple time_t
structure that contains a 32 bit number, so it can be
anytime you want
