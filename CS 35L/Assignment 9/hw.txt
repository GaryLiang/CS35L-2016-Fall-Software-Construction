The resulting network is still secure since all the bytes are encrypted
and only the private key can decrypted the information

1) if they can know the key strokes then the network is no longer safe
because the other team can know the information directly without any 
encryption

2) if the private key is stored in the USB than it is not safe since 
the other team can get what the private key is from physical technique.

if the privte key is not stored in the USB then it is safe since they 
need private key to decrypt message

since gpg --verify command only verifies to check whether the 
hash function of the data and the hash function of the signature
are the same
If the hacker knows my name and email address, then he can create
the signature using my name and email address and then send it to
the others. When the other people using gpg --verify, there will be
nothing wrong and they cannot tell whether the file has been 
modified or sent by the actual person.

To fix this issue, we need an authorized organization to verify the
identity of the sender who send the public keys by requiring the
certificate of the user.
