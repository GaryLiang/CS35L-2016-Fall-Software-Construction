sed -e 's/<[^>]*>//g' $1|
 grep -v -i '[cbdfgjqrstvxyz.]'|
 tr ',' '\n'| sed "s/\`/\'/g"|tr -d '\ ' |
 tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
 sort -u
exit 0


use the bash to execute the script

use sed -e 's/<[^>]*>//g' hwnwdseng.txt
to replace all the < > with nothing

use grep -v -i '[cbdfgjqrstvxyz]' to get rid of
the words that have those characters in them

use tr -d to delete the space
change upper case letters to lower case

use sort -u to sort everything and get
rid of the blanks

when I was trying to do:
sed s/"`"/"'"/g
it gives me error when the script is executed
saying that "unexpected EOF" while looking
for "`" therefore I cannot change "`" to "'"
then I found out the character for ` is \` and ' is \'

it counts the number of words found in the web but not in the words file
there are 33 words not found in words file
