git status
it gives me a list of changed but not updated files and a list of untracked file

8.
learnt the use of vs-diff, vc-revert and diff-apply-hunk

9.
emacs NEWS
C-x v =
C-x v u 
yes ENTER
C-x C-c

similar commands for the rest of non c files

emacs src/analyze.c
C-x v =
C-c 
C-x o
C-c C-a

similar commands for the rest of c files
but just need to check whether that hunk
is comment or not

10.
emacs src/diff3.c.rej
C-x C-f
diff.c ENTER

start changing ` to ' by going over the lines
between files using C-x b ENTER
similar process applied to diff.c

11.
remove all the untracked files

12.
git status
git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

put the patch into the file quote-3.0-patch.txt

13.
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
./boostrap
touch diffutils-gets.diff
emacs diffutils-gets.diff
copy the patch online
patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
makecheck

diff . -
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

diff --help
FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.


since the original bin file does not contain the help2man,
I need to get it from cs/bin file to the path 
run boostrap
craete diffutils-gets.diff file and copy the additional patch
since linux server 07 does not have gets
apply the gets patch
run configure to figure out the settings
install the program
test the new version to see whether the new diff works correctly

14.
mkdir diffutils-3.0
mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch
cp -r another4/gitroot/diffutils/src assignment4/gitroot/diffutils-3.0
cp -r assignment4/gitroot/diffutils/src assignment4/gitroot/diffutils-3.0-patch/
./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0/src diffutils-3.0-patch/src > quote-3.0-test.txt

make two directories
copy the source code from two different version
to different directories
use the diff to compare the difference of the source code of two directories and put the output
into quote-3.0-test.txt

15.
diff quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch

two files are not identical
it seems that some functions have been changed
but at the same time it shows that the issue 
of ` and ' have been fixed
